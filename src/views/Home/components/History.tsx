            THE WALDOS LEGEND is the realization of a wacky project created by a
            talented and ambitious team. Passionate about blockchain, NFT and
            especially hemp cultivation, we are creating through the Waldos the
            first NFT project focused on legal cannabis !

            What is this legend about? And why in Web3 is talking bout it? It is
            rooted in the story of the Waldos, dreamy young students full of
            ideals, like all of us, who sneaked out to meet up with friends and
            heard about a mysterious marijuana field abandoned by a coast guard
            who could not take care of it anymore. Thus, once a week at 4:20
            p.m. after school, the Waldos met to go on an adventure to find this
            treasure... But in the end, they couldn't make it...
          </p>
          <p className="font-text text-lg">
            Finally, the legend reappears through THE WALDOS LEGEND and all
            Waldos can now search for the abandoned field!
